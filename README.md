# Malware Visualization

## Ideas
 - Binary visualization to facilitate malware analysis
 - Binary visualization to facilitate exploitation
 - Dynamic binary visualization for debugging
 - Visualize the last debug session
 - Something with abstract interpretation

### Facilitate malware analysis
 - Record me completing all the PMA challenges and other book challenges, show how things like time spent in function, order of function visited, manually rated function importance, correlate with various function properties
 - Build a generative grammar on function properties to describe functionality
 - Start with HLIL graph, simplify it iterativley to get summary of functionality
 - Simplified function call graph, with generative grammar for function descriptions
