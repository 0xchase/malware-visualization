# Malware Visualization

## Concrete Ideas
### New function list
 - Sort functions by importance, hide some
 - Classify function as "networking", "file", etc in column
 - Generate text description of what function does
 
### RE observing statistics
 - Take data of reverse engineers analyzing malware
 - Run statistical analysis to determine what high-level features correlate with analysis time and order
 - Use high level features like function classification, complexity, height in call tree, etc with statistical analysis
 - Have reverse engineers mark the importance of each function to use with statistical analysis
 
### Function level visualizations
 - Generative grammar description for what function does
 - Advanced function summary graph with various properties

### Binary level visualizations
 - Call graph of the entire binary, but each node contains high-level properties. Only include important functions.

## Other
 - Binary visualization to facilitate exploitation
 - Dynamic binary visualization for debugging
 - Visualize the last debug session
 - Something with abstract interpretation
