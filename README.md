# Malware Visualization

## Final Plan
 - Basic plugin for custom function listing
   - Dynamic function sorting (using importance, height in call tree, understandability (are calls known), complexity, hide some
   - Function classification (networking, file, memory, etc)
   - Understandablity rating
 - Function level visualization
   - Build function summary graph
   - Extract important features to add to function summary
   - Simplify function summary graph
 - Function generative grammar
   - Generative grammar to create description for function
   - Add description to custom function listing
 - Binary level visualization
   - Visualize entire call graph
   - Label call graph with high level properties
   - Simplify entire call graph
 - Plugin to record reversing session - time spent in function, function importance rating, function visit order
 - Get participants to reverse engineer the malware. See if total time, time spent in unimportant functions, etc are reduced. Split data set into A and B set, participants can use visualization tools on half the set, see if time to understand malware is reduced.

## Concrete Ideas
### New function list
 - Sort functions by importance, hide some
 - Classify function as "networking", "file", etc in column
 - Generate text description of what function does
 - Column for understandability rating, based on if calls are known, complexity, etc
 
### RE observing statistics
 - Take data of reverse engineers analyzing malware
 - Run statistical analysis to determine what high-level features correlate with analysis time and order
 - Use high level features like function classification, complexity, height in call tree, etc with statistical analysis
 - Have reverse engineers mark the importance of each function to use with statistical analysis
 
### Function level visualizations
 - Generative grammar description for what function does
 - Advanced function summary graph with various properties

### Binary level visualizations
 - Call graph of the entire binary, but each node contains high-level properties. Only include important functions.

## Other
 - Binary visualization to facilitate exploitation
 - Dynamic binary visualization for debugging
 - Visualize the last debug session
 - Something with abstract interpretation
